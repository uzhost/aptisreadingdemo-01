        <div style="margin-bottom:18px;">
          <div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><b>1.</b> In recent years, children have become increasingly inactive. While technology often receives blame for this trend, it is not the only factor at play. Urbanization has led to a lack of safe play spaces for kids. Many neighborhoods no longer have parks or playgrounds, forcing children to stay indoors. This combination of screen time and limited physical activity opportunities is contributing to a decline in children's overall fitness and health.
            <select class="answer-input" id="p4ans0" style="margin-left:10px;width:60px;">
              <option value="">--</option><option value="A">A</option><option value="B">B</option><option value="C">C</option><option value="D">D</option><option value="E">E</option><option value="F">F</option><option value="G">G</option><option value="H">H</option>
            </select> <span class="answer-key" id="p4key0"></span>
          </div>
          <div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><b>2.</b> Currently, the issue of children not getting enough exercise is worsening, largely due to the time they spend staring at screens. The allure of laptops and smartphones is hard to resist, making it difficult for both parents and children to limit their use. As awareness grows about the importance of physical activity, it is essential for everyone to recognize the seriousness of this problem and work together to find effective solutions that encourage a more active lifestyle.
            <select class="answer-input" id="p4ans1" style="margin-left:10px;width:60px;">
              <option value="">--</option><option value="A">A</option><option value="B">B</option><option value="C">C</option><option value="D">D</option><option value="E">E</option><option value="F">F</option><option value="G">G</option><option value="H">H</option>
            </select> <span class="answer-key" id="p4key1"></span>
          </div>
          <div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><b>3.</b> One inspiring example comes from a teacher who implemented a program called the Daily Mile. Each day, students are encouraged to run at least one mile, and this simple idea quickly gained popularity. It has won awards for its effectiveness and has spread to over 3,500 schools in more than 30 countries, thanks to media coverage and positive testimonials. This initiative highlights how even small changes can have a significant impact on promoting physical activity among children.
            <select class="answer-input" id="p4ans2" style="margin-left:10px;width:60px;">

            </select> <span class="answer-key" id="p4key2"></span>
          </div>
          <div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><b>4.</b> The Daily Mile program not only enhances fitness levels among students but also has surprising benefits for their academic performance. Teachers have reported that students participating in this program are more focused and alert during lessons. Psychologists support this observation, suggesting that a healthy body leads to a healthy mind. The saying "a strong body, a strong mind" appears to hold true, as regular physical activity positively influences students' ability to learn and retain information.

          </div>
          <div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><b>5.</b> The design of our environments can significantly impact how we behave. For instance, workplaces are often designed to enhance productivity, and homes are structured to encourage communication. Similarly, schools can be designed to promote physical activity. By creating spaces that encourage movement, such as open areas for play and exercise, educators can foster a more active lifestyle among students, helping to counteract the trend of inactivity.

            </select> <span class="answer-key" id="p4key4"></span>
          </div>
          <div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><b>6.</b> One innovative architect from Japan has designed a kindergarten with a unique approach. The playground is structured like a running track, allowing children to run and play freely. This creative design has proven successful and has even received awards for its impact on children's activity levels. Such thoughtful architectural designs can inspire other schools to rethink how they create environments that promote both learning and physical activity.

            </select> <span class="answer-key" id="p4key5"></span>
          </div>
          <div style="margin-bottom:10px;"><b>7.</b> The Daily Mile initiative and the Japanese architect's playground represent two ends of the economic spectrum. The Daily Mile is a cost-effective program that requires minimal investment, while the architect's design involves significant funding. Local authorities must consider various factors when striving for a balance between promoting physical activity and managing budgets. By exploring both affordable and innovative solutions, communities can create environments that support children's health and well-being.
